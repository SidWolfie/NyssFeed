	<b><i>H</i></b>ave you ever thought of time travelling? I mean obviously, almost everyone does it, once in their life.<br>

	No, don't you dare think that I am about to review " The Time Machine" novel.<br>
	Let's put it this way: Thinking of Time Travelling, during your history teacher giving you your lessons on World War 1.<br>

	Thoughts of how it would have been great, to be the part of the politics of that time, to be a hero, who would be fighting for their people from being massacred, in a fight that wasn't yours, to begin with, and then be remembered in the future.<br><br>

	<p class="im"> <img class="m" src="../../IMG/3s.jpg"> </p>

<p>
	The novel "The Man From St Petersburg" by Ken Follett, revolves around the First World War timeline. This was the first time that the writer wrote on the First World War, and what's to expect from him, if not Excellency.<br>

	Germany is preparing to conquer Europe and be the greatest power in the same. But England has always been the most powerful country in Europe and the country, which has never been attacked.<br><br>
</p>


<p>
	Their citizens take pride in their country's development and power and would never want to be conquered. The only choice they are left with is to attack Germany first. Being aware of the power of Germany, England knows that they are destined to lose it, if not for external help.<br>

	And this is when Russia comes into light. England decides to ally with Russia and for that to happen, Lord Walden is made to make a contract with the czar Nicholas' nephew Prince Aleksei because he has lived in Russia and also has a Russian wife, Lydia.<br><br>

<p>
	You won't be able to put the book down unless you complete it. And here's more about this novel, to persuade you guys a little more.<br><br>


	A new character arrives on the stage, as things were going so smoothly. Feliks Kschessinsky, a ruthless anarchist, who fears nothing and feels nothing, as he claims.<br>

	He is The Man From St Petersburg, sent on a mission, given to him by his beliefs of anarchists, to stop the contract from being signed and the only way to do so is by killing Prince Aleksei.<br><br>

	Who knew that in this journey of Feliks, he would encounter his past, that will bring him closer to his death and the choices that Lydia will make to stop her secrets from being discovered, even if she has to do things that can affect the lives of the people she cares and loves the most. And in all this heat, Lydia's only daughter, Charlotte, with a curious mind, is set to find her reasons to fight, to find her place and purpose in this world.<br><br>

<p>
	<br><br>
	You will find yourself fascinated, with the way all these characters are interlinked, everyone fighting for their reasons and countries.<br><br>


	With the date before the contract is signed coming closer, The darkest secrets are coming on the surfaces, that would bring catastrophe and sleepless nights in Walden's life and Feliks will find himself distracted and lost in a mission, where one mistake can lead to getting caught by the Police of England.<br><br>
