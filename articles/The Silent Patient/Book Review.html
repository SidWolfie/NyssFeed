Until, one night, she shot her husband five times and became silent for forever. She becomes a walking statue, her eyes frozen and dark and so deep, that no one was able to reach her, except one.
<br><br><br>

Theo Faber, the forensic psychotherapist, who himself was a patient became a psychotherapist, just not to heal others but to heal himself too. He believed, there are no things like turning a good being to a murderer with just a snap.<br>
